# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository was taken from a starter code at Lighthouse Labs as my second project for the school. It consisted of client side coding and introduced me to the different trials and tribulations of front end development.  It includes HTML, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX, as well as JS, Express and Node.  Some dependecies added to help make the project "pop" included images from font-awesome, and a useful time rederer from time-ago.
